        <h1>About Python</h1>
        <p>
                Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
                Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design 
                philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace
                . Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers
                write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28]

              Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
             It supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
             structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, 
              and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included"
              language due to its comprehensive standard library.[29]

            Python was conceived in the late 1980s 
            as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0,
            released in 2000, introduced features like list
            comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of
            collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0,
            released in 2008, was a major revision of the
            language that is not completely backward-compatible,
            and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
