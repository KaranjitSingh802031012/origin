        <h1>About JAVA</h1>
            <p>
               Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and
               designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers
               write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled 
               Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without
               the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically
               compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
               regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java
               is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either
               of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages 
               in use according to GitHub,[18][19] particularly for client-server web applications,
               with a reported 9 million developers.
