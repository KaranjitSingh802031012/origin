        <h1>About AI</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn.
                It is also a field of study which tries to make computers "smart".
                They work on their own without being encoded with commands.
                John McCarthy came up with the name "artificial intelligence" in 1955.
                According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, 
                John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines,
                especially intelligent computer programs”.

               Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, 
               or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.

               AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, 
               and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of
               developing intelligent software and systems.
