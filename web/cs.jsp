            <p>

             or information technology security (IT security)
             is the protection of computer systems and networks 
             from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software,
             or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

The field is becoming more important due to increased
reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless network s
tandards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart"
devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices tha
t constitute the "Internet of things". Owing to its complexity, both in ter
ms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world.
